## Bayesian Time Series

### About

This is a project for a Bayesian statistics course at San Diego State University. Our group members are Andrew Bates, Joshua Gloyd, and Tyler. The purpose of this project is to create a tutorial on the use of a Bayesian model of our choosing. We decided on a Bayesian Structural Time Series model. In our tutorial, we will provide and introduction to the theoretical basis of the model and illustrate its application by analyzing a data set using the R package [bsts](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bsts/index.html). The model and package is based on the paper by Steven L. Scott and Hal Varian which can be found [here](http://www.inderscience.com/offer.php?id=59942).
